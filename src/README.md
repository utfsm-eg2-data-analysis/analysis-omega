# omegaThesis

GetSimpleTuple    : takes RAW data, uses Analyser & ClasTool to filter the signals
                    and assign the respective identification of particles

FilterNCombine    : takes the pruned data and filters events which have at least one
	            omega particle, and keep all the possible combinations

MakePlots         : plots different kinematic variables (kinvar) for data, simrec or gsim

MakePlots-DvsR    : plots the same kinvar for data and simrec

MakePlots-2D      : does 2D histograms, generally Q2:Nu and Z:Pt2 for data and simrec

old_MakePlots     : uses the old format (filtered files from OmegaID)

GetQuantiles      : fix a kinvar and fix a number! it obtains the equally distributed bins

GetElectronNumber : it obtains the electron numbers, directly from pruned data

MakeRooFits       : first program for the bkg subtraction
	            it is suggested to run it twice, to gather better fit ranges

PlotParams        : plot the parameter results of the fits

MakeMR-nbs        : from the fits results, calculates MR integrating n*sigma around the
	            peak

MakeMR-bs         : from the fits results, calculates MR direcly from the omega number
	            and bkg number parameters
