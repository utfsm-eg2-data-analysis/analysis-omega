The analysis presented here consist of the measurement eta meson electro-production off nuclei in SIDIS events. The measured observable is the Multiplicity Ratio (MR) which is the ratio between the cross section measured in a nuclear environment to deuterium. The data was taken by the  E02-104 experiment carried out in the EG2(c) run during 2004. The experiment uses a double target system which includes a liquid Deuterium target and a solid target, which are exposed together to the 5.014 GeV electron beam. The experiment uses the standard Clas detector hardware to register the events.  

The solid targets analysed here are C, Fe and Pb and correspond to the targets with larger statistic. The MR dependency over $Q^2$, $p_T^2$, $\nu$ and $z$ is measured and a comparison with $\pi^0$ is performed within the two gamma decay channel.
