===========

Rules to form an artificial omega. There will be **original events** and **constructed events**.

* Final state particles come from candidate events (at least 1pi+, 1pi-, 2gamma)

* All particles must come from different events.

* The particles' original electrons must come from the same binning in (Q2, Nu) = (10 x 10).

* The particles' original electrons must come from the same target. (Vertex cuts)

* The constructed particles must be rotated w.r.t. the constructed electron, in base of their original directions w.r.t. the original electron.
